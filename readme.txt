== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I posted a photo to Instagram but a post on my blog wasn’t created!?! =

Don’t worry. There seem to be a couple of gremlins in the Instagram Real-time service from time to time. The In-RealTime plug-in compensates for this by requesting the previous 8 posts and checking to see if the images have been saved to your server. The missing post(s) should be created the next time you post to Instagram.
